This was a project for my Java programming class, in it it'll judge whether a number enter a certain range is a prime number or not until you enter -1. Doprime is the meat of the project, it's the part that actually termines if a number is prime or not. It uses DoMod to determine its boundaries (which was a requirement for the project). DoMod also determines the code which was necessary to escape to loop, being -1. The last part main() is just the part where I can determine the lower boundary, and was used to round up all of the functions.
